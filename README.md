mstpd (Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol daemon)
==========

Important Note
----------

As the note (near the title says) this is not the original repo of **mstpd**.

It's a "fork" from SourceForge and the origin link is:
 https://sourceforge.net/projects/mstpd/

And the original author is: Vitalii Demianets <dvitasgs@gmail.com>

Description
-----------

**msptd** implements the IEEE 802.1s Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol.

It was original started by Vitalii Demianets.

The work seems to be based on [**rstpd**](https://github.com/shemminger/RSTP).

This repo tries to converge the original works of rstpd/mstpd and the works of
others (e.g. Cumulus Linux).

There are 2 main branches:
- **upstream** - which is a git-svn clone from SourceForge
- **master** - generic updates (on top of uptream)
